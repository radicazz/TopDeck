I've placed the models in said folder, let explain the naming convention real quick

Longtower = your regular tower, medium range, medium damage, average fire rate (Your ol reliable assualt rifle build)
Shorttower = your small tower, short range, low damage, fast fire rate (Your pack a punch SMG build)
Snipertower = your sniper tower, long range, High damage, slow fire rate (Your cannon sniper build)

*Your longtower is named Model_Defender so you might have to alter or delete that

UPGRADES
-------------------
_HealthUpgrade = Upgrades the health so it looks like it adds armor, this is you standard upgrade
_MiscUpgrade = A miscellaneous upgrade, it alters the model subtlely, i was thinking attack speed but you can make it something else 
_FullUpgrade = The model has both Misc and Health upgrades to it hence full

**The Sniper tower doesn't need upgrades since we gonna make it OP

DEFENDERS
------------------
_Basic = your basic defender, average dmg, average atk speed, average health (Solid beginner unit)
_Advanced = you badmaan/bigboi defender, Very High dmg, average atk speed, Very High health (Real tank and dmg unit)

Adjust the cost price as you see fit, obv the better the more expensive (duh XD)

ATTACKERS
------------------
Attacker = Regular Grunt, average dmg, average atk speed, average health (Your regulars)
Attacker2 = Fast Rogue, low dmg, high atk speed, low health (Can be a nuisance)
Attacker3 = Big boi, Very High dmg, average atk speed, Very High health (They are like brutes, hard to beat but can be fought off by Advanced defenders)
